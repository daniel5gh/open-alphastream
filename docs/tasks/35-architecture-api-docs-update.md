# Update Documentation for New Architecture and API

## Objective
Update architectural and product documentation to reflect the consolidation of handle/processor, C ABI refactor, cache/scheduler integration, and new API/architecture.

## Scope
- Update [docs/adr/0009-handle-vs-processor.md](../adr/0009-handle-vs-processor.md) to reflect completed consolidation and C ABI changes.
- Update [docs/prd/prd-alphastream-rs.md](../prd/prd-alphastream-rs.md) for new API, cache, and scheduler integration.
- Ensure all diagrams, API signatures, and architectural descriptions are current.

## Deliverables
- Updated ADR for handle/processor consolidation and C ABI refactor.
- Updated PRD for new architecture and API.

## Checklist
- Revise ADR 0009 for completed consolidation and refactor.
- Update PRD for new API, cache, and scheduler integration.
- Ensure all documentation is consistent and up to date.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ADR and PRD accurately describe the new architecture and API.
- No outdated references to AlphaStreamHandle or old C ABI remain.
- Documentation is clear and complete for developers and stakeholders.
